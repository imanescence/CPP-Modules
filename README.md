# C++ Modules
## 9 modules in order to learn oriented object


This project reflects my learning path through C++98, covering both fundamental and advanced concepts. I started with a basic PhoneBook application to practice class design and input/output handling. Along the way, I explored polymorphism, the orthodox canonical form, and operator overloading. I also deepened my understanding of pointers vs references and manual memory allocation. The modules introduced abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance, as well as exception handling using try, catch, and throw. I worked with different types of casts, implemented templates, and used containers and iterators from the STL, particularly through the <algorithm> library. A small CSV-based database project helped put these skills into practice. I concluded the journey by implementing the Ford-Johnson merge-insert sort algorithm as a final challenge.
