# C++ Modules
## 9 modules in order to learn oriented object


This project reflects my learning path through **C++98**, covering both fundamental and advanced concepts. I started with a 80s style **basic PhoneBook**. Along the way, I explored **polymorphism**, the importance of **orthodox canonical form**, and the praticality of **operator overloading**. I also deepened my knowledge with **references** which the using was quite new in comparison to the pointers in C. The modules introduced **abstract classes**, **interfaces**, and **inheritance**, as well as exception handling using **try**, **catch**, and **throw**. I worked with different types of **casts**, implemented **templates**, and used **containers** and **iterators** from the **STL** through the **<algorithm>** library. A small **CSV-based database** exercise helped put these skills into practice. I concluded the journey by **implementing the Ford-Johnson merge-insert sort algorithm** as a final challenge.
